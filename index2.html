<br><u><strong>personal information:</strong></u></br>
<br>Name:jorge Esteban Artalejo Rivas </br><br> student no:s387495</br> <br> Email address:s3874915@student.rmit.edu.au</br> 
<br><u> <strong>1. Introduction:</strong></br></u>
<p>My name is Jorge Esteban Artalejo Rivas .Im 35 years old and I’m originally from Mexico.  
I was born in the city of Tijuana, in the state of Baja California on the 23/05/1985
The Mexican culture is mix of Spanish and indigenous cultures that existed before the Spanish arrive.  
 I was born in catholic family from the both side of my family. In Mexico we speak Spanish, about 97% of the people speaks Spanish. 
 There are other many autochthonous languages in the country spoken by indigenous communities. 
I studied from 2007 until 2010 the career of environmental sciences in the Tecnologico  de cajeme in Cuidad Obregon Sonora.  
One fact about myself  that I consider really cool is that  I love to play  football soccer,  if I have a day off  and there is social soccer  
 that’s where you can find me!!  For a hobby I like to play video games.
I like games that have powerful stories like for example “Metal gea solid” I also like to watch documentaries about 
technology, politics, economy or history as well to read. my favourite subjects in school were history, geography chemistry and maths</p>

<div> <u><strong> 2 Interest in IT</strong></u><p style="font-family:arial;"></p> I really become interested in IT about 3 years ago. After working in the retail business, I always found myself on the phone with the IT support team , 
 requesting for  sales report, prices changes, inventory reports , stock rotation reports  and I realize how important is  IT to every business. 
 IT is very powerful tool to have inside the business if you want to be successful.
 I really enjoy working with computers and learning how the system’s network, works. Another part of IT that 
 I really enjoy is the part were you have to think, figuring out the issues and possible solutions.</div><br>

<div><u>Why do i choose RMIT:</u>wwhen I decided to start a carrier in IT,  the first place I started to search for information was the internet(of course)  
I end up in the  Open universities  website, then  I spoked to a consultant  which guide me with the best options given my situation. 
Which is no experience on IT as well I finish school 9 years ago.  The process was easy and fast. 
I spoke to a consultant who answer all my questions and guided me to my best option.  Now here I am </div><br>

<div><u> What do i expect: </u>I expect this course to teach me everything that I need to know on how to start a career on IT support or maybe a different area. 
Another area of IT I’m interested to, is on cloud computing and programming. I know IT is very complex career with many branches that I still have to discover.
 Back when I was in university, I had a programming class where I use MATLAB, and create my own programs and run code. 
 I expect this course to be more complex but with some similarities involving maths or maybe some Numerical analysis as we get more in dept of things.</div><br>


<u><strong> 3 Ideal job:</strong> </u><br<p>IT Support Specialist, 	I’m very appeal to this position because I believe that this is a foot in the door into a new career. 
 I think learning IT support is great start for someone like me, with very little experience in this field.   But with great experience in the retail business.
 I believe in combining this two, into my own knowledge  I can expand my skills.
I’m very interested in learning how computers networks function and how they communicate, how to fix problems and how to identify them.  
this is where most of my interest lays on for now</br></p>

<div><u> The plan to obtain the skills and qualifications that i need: </u>in order to obtain the knowledge that I need to be a competent IT support specialist. I would need to learn  the general knowledge of  what is IT and what is use for.  Learn the different tools that IT has to offer and how they work.  With my experience in retail I would be able to understand how I can use IT in the business sector and how I can contribute to incorporate changes or make valuable surjections on how this technology can work better in the business sector.
this is just the beginning, I would have to learn about the system that are being use and how they work, a few case studies would be good to learn on how real-life problems are address and what solutions were giving. And what knowledge this people have, that make them able to solve these issues. 
Last but not least, I would like to create a project where I can put to work the knowledge that I’ve develop during this course</div>

<u><strong>4 personal profile:</strong></U><p> Mayers-Brigss result:Campaigner</p>
<div><img src="image4index2.png"></div>
<u>Result of and online learning style test:</u><p>Type, ISTJ introvert(3%) sensing ( 6%) thinking (19%) judging(12%)</p>
<p>•	ISTJs, interest in learning a subject stem from the question, “Is this practical and useful to me?” The more precisely they can learn how something can be put to use
 or how they can operate it, the greater their interest in the topic and the greater their desire to apply what they learn</p>
 <p>•	Their interest in studying something is driven by the desire to gain experience in successfully implementing plans or carrying out hands-on activities.</p>
 <p>•	ISTJs are capable of grasping material that has logical flow and material that consists of a set of practical information.
 They can take in large sets of conceptually unrelated information like facts or instructions. 
 They are most receptive to new material when it is delivered using straightforward, real-life examples. 
 ISTJs understand learned information concretely, and they immediately grasp how it can be practically applied.
 They are capable of learning independently, especially if the material is of practical nature. 
 Group work with the material gives an ISTJ no advantage compared to independent work.</P>
 <p>•	ISTJs are able to actively and effectively apply material they have learned and understood well in concrete tasks.</p>
 <p>•	ISTJs have a high degree of tolerance to high levels of learning related stress. They prefer to evenly distribute their efforts when learning new material.</p></div>
 
 <u>Big five personality test:</u><p>This Big Five assessment measures your scores on five major dimensions of personality: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism (sometimes abbreviated OCEAN). 
 Check out your scores on each of the five dimensions in the graph below, then read on to discover what each score means.</p></div>
 
 <div><img src="image5index2.png"></div>
 
 <u>Result:</u><br><p><u>•	What do the results of these tests mean to me</u>:  first I found this test to know me more than I know myself.  
 now I know i have a place where I can read and learn more about my personality and understand how I can work with other people. 
 I can understand how other people would react to my actions due to my personality.  
 I believe this can help me to develop new ideas and approaches to different situations in my life and  to create better relations with other people</p></br>
 
 <u><p>•	How do I think these results may influence my behaviour in a team?</u> I would be able to understand myself better and learn how to choose what I want.
 What I need and what I can give to my team. Also I would be able to understand my team mates, as well they can understand me better and probably build a strong relation or
 have more empathy for one and other.</P></br>
 <u><p>•	How should I take this into account when forming a team?</u>First, I would like to know if my personality creates conflict with another team member personality. 
 Then maybe we can talk about things before they become problems that can affect our projects or marks.</p></br>
 
 <u><p><strong>5.project idea:</strong></u>Stock take control App</P>
 <u><p>•	Overview:</u>I would like to create a stock take control app, that would be easy to use, help to reduce the time it takes to do stock take and be accurate with the result.
 Doing stock take can be very tedious and time consuming. Some business doesn’t have the technology need it (RFID scanner) and recur to do stock take, by manually count
 each individual item, leaving too much room for mistake.</p> 
 <u><p>•	Motivation:</u>I am attracted to this idea because I’ve been in this situation where we must count supermarkets stock or retail shops and it has to be counted by one item at the time... 
 I always thought that there must be a easier way to do this by using IT Technologies.</p>  
<u><p>•	Description:</u>:  this would be an application with similar functions to and RFID scanner.   The number of items would be entered manually and then the user would be taking a picture of the barcode item.  
 Then the data would be store in a data base. After all the stock has been counted with the phone app.  
 Then both data, would link and compared the number of stock counted by the app and the number of stock in the system. 
 Then system would generate a final report with the variances.   This technology can help other business that don’t have much resources for this kind of tasks.
 It would save them money by not having to roster extra staff and would save them money by shortening the time required to perform the stock take.</p>   
<u><p>•	Tools and technologies:</u>for this idea to become a real project, I would need some sort of coding language to help me develop this app. 
Learn more how to create databases how can this two can communicate</p>
<u><p>•	Skills required :</u>coding language , java , hmtl or any other that would suit this application. I believe that I would need as well to work on my social skills in order to achieve collaboration with other people that might be interested in this project.
 I feel comfortable that I would probably obtain the knowledge that I need to develop this idea with this course. And as time pass and I learn more, this idea would probably evolved.
 One last skill I believe i need is to have determination to make things until finish.</p>
<u><p>•	Outcome</u>if this idea becomes real, it would heavily benefit any business . this would help  reduce time , reduce human error and save money </p>
